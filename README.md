# "Tower" Augmented Reality Application
The "Tower" AR app is a simple interactive experience created using A-Frame. Initially, it displays a single cube. Users can click on the cube to stack another cube on top, allowing them to build a tower, one cube at a time.

## System Requirements:
- A modern web browser with WebVR/WebXR support, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
- A device with a camera for AR capabilities.

## Installation Instructions:
- Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine or web server.
- If running locally, start a local server to avoid cross-origin issues.

## Usage:
1. Launch the application in a compatible web browser.
2. Interact with the visible cube by clicking on it.
3. Upon each click, a new cube will be added on top of the previous topmost cube.
4. Continue clicking to build your tower as tall as you like.

## Features:
- Single Cube Start: Begins with a single cube to initiate the interaction.
- Stacking Mechanism: Clicking the topmost cube adds another cube on top.
- Infinite Building: There is no limit to how many cubes can be stacked.

## Customization:
To adjust the size of the cubes, color, or other properties, you can modify the A-Frame entity parameters within the HTML file.
